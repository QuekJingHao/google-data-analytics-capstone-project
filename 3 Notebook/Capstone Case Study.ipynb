    "<u>**Scenario**:</u> You are working as a Business Intelligence Analyst at a defense agency in the government. Recently, your agency is outsourcing an important project to an external defense contractor. Since will be an expensive undertaking, the project manager only wants the best defense company to be awarded the tender. Hence, he has tasked you to conduct an analysis of the historical data of the top 100 defense companies' revenue. Your job is to identify the most suitable firm(s) to be awarded the contract. At the last step of the analysis, you will present your results and give a recommendation to the project manager and chief finanicial officer (CFO) of the agency.\n",
